# Wireless-Administration-Tool
An all-in-one place for your wireless needs!


## Wifi Tools
So far, I've started the first page added which deals with Wifi. This will allow you to scan for networks around you, while
displaying their SSID, Security Type, and Signal Strength. I plan on developing in a way to show the channels of the access points so one is able to differentiate between APs with the same name (as in two different strength broadcasts).

I've also added a place which will show you your current Wifi data.
This includes your current network and your IPv4 and IPv6 address for said network. In the future, I'm planning on adding
a spot for your MAC address.

I also plan on adding a way to disconnect from the network and connect to another one which will include a password prompt.

Below is an example screenshot of what I currently have:

## Bluetooth Tools
Apart from Wifi, I plan on trying to implement a way to interface with the computer's Bluetooth to show available devices around
and allow management of those.

## What I've learned so far from this project:

This has really allowed me to further utilize Winforms with C#. I also learned from using the NativeWifi Api how networking
data and information is stored as well as how to parse it properly for my needs.

With the multiple wireless devices one can use, I've learned how to create and manage larger projects with WinForms and how they 
coincide together.
